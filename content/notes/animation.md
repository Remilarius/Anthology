## Before getting started 
- Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life
- Make sure hardware can render (RTX and whatnot)

### One man operations
- Monty Oum (RvB, RWBY, Dead Fantasy)
- Syama Pederson (Astartes)

### Costs:
- Autodesk Maya: $1,500 per year as a subscription (I think Maya is free due to educational license for me)
- Blender (Free)
- Poser (Free)


## Monty Oum (RvB, RWBY, Dead Fantasy)
Applications: [Source](https://www.creativebloq.com/animation/rbwy-anime-action-dynamic-3d-twist-9134477#:~:text=Using%20Poser%20gave%20us%20the%20power%20to%20animate%20cool%20visuals&text=My%20work%20in%20the%20last,animated%20almost%20entirely%20in%20Poser.)

### RWBY Workflow
1. Primarily Smith Micro's Poser (RvB and RWBY both, he noted the efficiency)  
2. Assets were built in Autodesk Maya -> imported in Poser for rigging and texturing  
3. MoCap OptiTrackâ€™s Arena, BVH (Biovision Hierarchial Data) -> imposed on the Poser rigs and cleaned up

List: Poser Pro, Maya, ZBrush, Softimage, 3ds Max, After Effects, Premiere, Photoshop, particleIllusion

### Dead Fantasy Workflow
 - Poser 7 - Rendering, Animating, Rigging
 - Director MX - Compositing
 - Maya - Modeling
 - Particle Illusion - Particle effects
 - Adobe Premiere - Timeline, Syncing final output
 - Xnview - Image Conversion

Notes:  
Monty mostly used mocap for acting purposes  
Everything is also a gun, not the best idea to emulate.  
RWBY moved to be animated in Autodesk Maya after Vol. 3, and at 24FPS when Vol.1&2 were at 30FPS 

## Syama Pederson (Astartes)

Equipment and Applications:

1. 3dsmax
2. Substance Painter
3. Redshift Renderer and Fusion for compositing (Arnold?)
4. Rokoko Mocap Suit to get basic motion

Time spent: 4-5 months per episode, around 2mins per episode, 12mins total.

Sound: Pulled from free libraries and mixed.

Traditional camerawork/Hayao Miyazaki

Notes:
- Parts 1-4 were rendered on a lone GTX-1070
- Astartes armor is made of ceramite
- Displacement textures maps vs rendering entire object


## Notes
- [Interpolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KRb_qV9P4g) (and why some frames look wack at 60FPS) 

### Things that will be hard:
- Camerawork
- Character model design 

### Notable Shows
- Fate Zero
- RvB
- Astartes
- RWBY

### Other Animators
1. Danger Noodle Animations (Team NYON, Monty emulator)
2. 3D Satisfying Animations
    - Andreas Wannerstedt
    - Arben Vllasaliu
    - Corridor Crew

### Series w/characters that have strong concepts
- Fate Zero (Pulled from mythology, Irish/English/Meso/Greek/Roman/Norse)
- RWBY (Fairy Tales/Mythology)
