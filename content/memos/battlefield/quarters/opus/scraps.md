"It's merely because you are more fun to play with alive than dead, but that's besides the point. Heroes like you, they live fast and die young, spending their lives on such ephermal causes."

"I'm more qualified than anyone here!"  
"You have a history of taking unnecessary risks -"   
"I've matured!"  
"-and completing tasks with childish flair."  
"I - You can't judge me by that, I -"  
"And most importantly, you have a tendency to be suicidal when the stakes are high."  
"Olivia -"  
"I'm not going to appoint someone I have to replace in two weeks. Good day, Captain Jaworski."

"So you want to lose? What good is that going to do? Get up and fight."
