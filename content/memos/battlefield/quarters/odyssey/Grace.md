I remember that I thought that to be with Yaretzi, I would definitely have had to 


I'm like a moth, seeking the light that would be my own destruction.

I believe that the best change in the world comes from people who are the most deeply unhappy with it. I've never had a problem being deeply unhappy at the world before and Grace is dangerous in this respect. I don't want to be melodramatic but I wonder if I wasn't dating her, work would be more appealing.



Being with the right person is easy, I just didn't think they existed.

It's my first time around too, but you give me all the confidence I need, Grace.

I feel like I keep going under, I can't see properly.

I'm used to my feelings not being reciprocated and I thought I'd be pretty okay with it for the rest of my life, I don't know how to feel now 

I'm use to loving uselessly.

I had dream that Grace was facing some type of terminal illness or some other cause of death, we were resign to that fact, but even afterwards I was desolate. I couldn't accept that there wasn't a way to see her again and thought death would be the only way.

I felt very taken care of. She dried my hair and fed me and I'd never thought it would be a thing that could happen.

She's kinda hot when she plays the piano.

I had a thought this morning. My self destructive tendencies, they're ever present. 
I've always walked to close to the edge of ruination, intentionally or not.
This time around, they'll be effecting more than just me.
I have to beat it.
