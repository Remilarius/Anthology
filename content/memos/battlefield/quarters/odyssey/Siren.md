## Sealed

### Aftermath

I think I got over it suprisingly quickly, being rejected, it didn't really hurt. I think I only realized the magnitude of which I could've fucked up afterwards when I couln't debrief myself and nobody else could satisfactorily either.

### To Do List

1. Her birthday is June 9th
2. Give her red beans at some point

I really can't tell if what do to myself sometimes is out of a sense of duty or just to cause myself suffering.

It's really frustrating to have the foresight to be able to see exactly what problems will arise and being unable to do anything about it.

Fighting myself is hard.

### Protocols

1. Contain the negativity and make sure she's not exposed to too much of it.
2. Don't overstep and don't be protective
3. Don't let her know how deep you're under
4. Stop thinking
5. Don't be needy
6. Find a way to distract yourself if you're spiraling
7. Patch up the soft spots and weak points

1. Make sure she finds another friend/replacement
2. She's not as confident as one would think, careful of that

Deadline June 21th, 2021

I either need to get over it in the next month or so that I can interact normally or I need to tell her and be prepared to lose her.

1. Don't bother Saba about Siren
2. Tell Stephon the codename was apt and yell at him for not preventing this mess
3. Make sure they prevent the whole shipwreck phase

### May 23, 2021

Harvard tryhards are a bunch of bottoms.

She needs to know I'm not sticking around because I like her as more than her friend and I need to know she's not just coming to me because she doesn't have anyone else and is captive.

### May 22, 2021

I didn't realize how much she would've been missed until after I tried debriefing myself.

There's the passing thought that I just wanted her as a friend but she wouldn't stay unless she had more and I agreed to keep her around at any cost, and that's now the only way I can make sure the people I care about stay.

### May 18, 2021

She called eariler this time. Probably anticipated the dinner time deadline.

I realized after that she reminds of me back in high school, wondering if my emotional range was confined to 

I'll play this game if I have to.

### May 17, 2021

She was taking 6 classes?? How did she still have time?

### May 16, 2021

I feel like I'm going through withdrawal. This is a problem. I need to figure out a way to interact with her without losing my mind.

Most of these problems are self inflicted. I need to reduce thinking hours and let everything fall in perspective.

If only I could stop thinking.

### May 09, 2021

I'm still not certain.  

She keeps peeling away my layers with ease.  

When Dean Derzon and Shahara ask about these things, I dodge and I weave and I tell jokes to deflect, and they've accused me of just as much, but they still couldn't pin me down even if they wanted too.

Condition 1: It’s determined that I have no chance, which in that case, she will either never know or it’ll be revealed to her in good time if we’re still on good terms.  
Condition 2: Recklessness (probably egged on by Stephon) + reasonable chance of things working out in my favor.  
Condition 3: My motives and decisions have been significantly compromised and she needs to know.  
Condition 4: It’s gone on for too long and she should know.  
Condition 5: We could be functionally dating and I’m a coward, in that case, the letter will be handed to her or I will tell her.  



### Something I must've written late semester

It hasn't gotten better.

Your presence saturates my days. I'm carried through my days in the stream of time, not thinking too much.

I don't know what's proper yet, if I don't want to repeat my mistakes, I should probably figure that out.

I remember being fairly needy texting wise near the end of my relationship with Yaretzi, which was an odd developement on my end, seeing as I could never reply to people on time.
