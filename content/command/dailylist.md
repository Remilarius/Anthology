"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more." -Jane Austen

It's about who wants it worse and good just has to win. And good has the advantage since most people have the tendency to be good.

You're only good when you're not happy.

When the world changes for the better, old people can't keep up sometimes, you can only wait for those to die, but life expectancy is increasing, change comes slower. But if it changes for the worse, maybe they'll help pull us back.
