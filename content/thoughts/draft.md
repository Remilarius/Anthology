She was on the swing next to me, in her pastel and flowery attire, and I looked down at myself, in my black pants and grey shoes, and I'd never felt so colorless before then.


Give me hope when I shouldn't
Lift my wings as they melt,
Tell me I'll get through it,
because I will
but how do of myself is left?

And I don't want it unless I can have it all.


I've got too many problems
I'm hoping I'll die before I have to solve em
I don't know how it got complex
I've built myself a god complex

I dodge all the attempts to make me face my own feelings

I can't feel anything, I can't be happy, can't be mad
These days I just can't stay awake
I don't know if I still wanna live
My friends think I might have depression,
Well if this is depression, I've had it for too long
It goes away every once in a while
and I think I'm safe
but it always comes back


I guess I'm selfish, I won't go to therapy
I'll take it out on the people around me

The only way I know if I want to live is trying to die
and even then I can't seem to that

As the water closes over me,
It's calm for once
Is this the only way to know?

Maybe I need other people to know what I am,
If they tell me, maybe I could do it

Why don't you give up then?
Your actions and your words (don't make sense) are contradictory
You don't have it in you, do you?

It's not your place,
Go home
I don't belong, but can't I stay
No, it's not your place
Where is my place?
It's a grave, it's where you'll end up anyways
why don't you get there faster
None of it matters, why do you still try?

I'll make it matter.

You keep saying you want to off yourself,
so why don't you?
You say that you want to die, don't want to try,
so why don't you?
You've already been written off a long time ago,
why do you still struggle?
If you're still waiting for an answer to your questions,
they're not coming,
it's not how the world works.


I can't believe I cared enough to be hurt

Of course, there's only one way to find out. I would imagine before my lungs start to hurt, there'll be peace and the quiet that I've been seeking.

I wake up when the sun does. In these early mornings, I'm left alone. I can't tell if I want company or not.

When I'm sitting on that bridge.

And now that I'm facing the same problem I was two years, I should be able to weather this better. I think I will.

I just need to do something else. 


The person that comes out of this will be better, but I wonder what the cost will be. I've always been faced with the decision of quitting or not, and I've always chosen not to, despite the temptation.

I feel fragmented.

I don't think Saba's wrong about much, and I don't trust my own judgment right now.

I know that I'm stubborn at times, I don't think I can change that


I wonder how much of my past I'm still holding on to. I thought it wouldn't matter anymore, because 

I'm just very tired of being where I don't belong, 

You can feel that person pulling away, just a little bit, and you realize it's only a matter of time before they leave for certain. You can only prepare yourself and hope it only hurts so much.

She's an emotional blindspot. I dunno why considering that she's not as close as other people

I don't like the amount of damage we could inflict on each other.

She's flighty.

When I'm alone, I 

I've think I've told her once before that the worst thing someone could do to me was 

because I'm powerless

I am a magnificent bastard, and I won't emotions of all things bring me down.
