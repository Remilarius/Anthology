I. Life’s an open ended question, so what’s your answer?
It’s not a good one but it’s the one I have for now

II. All those without a sun march in the dark.
We don’t get a sun to see by, wandering in the dark until we figure it out.

III. Ying and Yang

IV. Vase

V. Puzzle

VI. Porcupine
“Because it was my only defense against the cruelty in the this world, and while it protects me from the worst of it, it also prevents anyone from getting to close to me, lest they get hurt.”

VII. Well of despair

VIII. Into Thin Air (On Mountaintops above the Cloudline)

IX. Steel jawed trap

“And being the type of people we are, we gritted our teeth and cut our hand off, never stopping to think that we could never hold hands with anyone after that.” 

X. Caged

XI.
The sea, and I'm the anchor

XII.
Chalkboard Hallway



Tunnel vision shrinking, I’m running out of air
Diving this deep into the well of despair

They never gave me a warning to beware
I guess I should’t have expected it to be fair

I’ve reached the point of no return 
Oxygen’s low, lungs are starting to burn

High ground at low tide
There’s nowhere to hide

I’m glad I was happy, even only for awhile
I should've known it wouldn't last, it was only a trial
