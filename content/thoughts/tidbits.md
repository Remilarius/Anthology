I'm always walking one step away from ruination.

I believe in power through competence.

From 11-16 years old, I had to make conscious deliberate decisions to change, looking back, it's kinda crazy because people can't usually just change one day on a whim, because of inertia or other reasons. I"ve really only settled here as a person in the last few years.

I like video games/media where you learn terrible truths.

My mum's threat to kick me out has been a long standing one. It's worn off by now, but it used to be very effective. I had no recourse but to accept the conditions she set. Now that I'm older and more capable, that threat seems more like and invitation to escape instead.

I guess I'd rather freeze than wear that jacket.

Maybe there'll be somebody that'll stop me from wanting the world.

I've been saying that'll I'll die at 29, hopefully having completed the problems I set out to solve. I don't think I'm really joking, but it's alarming if I'm not, 

I can't imagine what lies beyond that year, 

I don't know if there's anything for me after that. I don't derive any pleasure from life it seems like, maybe that's why I want to be done and over with quickly.

What was the point?

It was easy when I didn't feel the same way, because I knew at some point they'd be hurt but it wouldn't be me, I'd feel sorry for them at some point, but that'd be all.

When you're diving or swimming, there's a point of no return, you commit or you turn back.
