Yeah, maybe I have a death wish
It's at the top of my bucket list

I can't regulate my own emotions
and I'm selfish, I won't go to a therapist
I'm afraid they won't understand but
I don't think I'm special, it's just the shit I've been through.


It’s just that the path I lead leaves me with just apathy
And it makes me just a little bit

Numb,

You can hurt me all you want, I can't feel the pain.
There's something wrong with my brain, but I can't complain.

Life can’t get any tougher, I was meant to suffer.
But what does it all mean? I wonder.

You want me to give up that life,
But don't you see that's all I know?

Well to hell I don't

You said I was your one and only,
but you said that just to own me
said that to try to control me

What if I can't get back up?
What if I want to die
Won't you let me?


Can't you come find me?  
I'm just a little bit lost in time  
There's nothing I can call mine  


Children pay for the sins of their parents  
The toll from all these problems that we inherit  
Couldn't be made more apparent  
when our dreamscapes are so barren  


I'm not where I'm suppose to be  
Suppose to live out my life in obscurity  
Surprised they're not calling security  

It's just harmonic motion  
Who gave you the right to come into my heart and cause a commotion  


I got the fight beat into me  
That's all I know how to do  
Best take me for a fool
