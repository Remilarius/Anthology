And I wonder if I keep trying to find solace in another person to stop myself from chasing what I cannot obtain.

I am only good when I am in the grips of my rage.

### Excerpts from Era Siren

&emsp; [I need to stop thinking. People just need someone to care about them sometimes. It's just hard to let them in. It's weird that you can understand what my friends can't sometimes. You haven't personally experienced some of it, but you still are quite understanding.  
&emsp; You're not perturbed or shocked by some of what I've told you. It's nice not to be treated like I'm broken or inhuman.]


&emsp; [Chronologically, there might be an issue if I keep this to myself for too long. There's something to be said about pining heroically, but I'm worried about my fondness clouding my motives and decisions regarding her.  
&emsp;I met her mid-October, and sporadically met for physics tutoring. I didn't think much of it then,]

[My mind is a mess. I can't keep anything straight, I keep thinking about everything I have to do instead of doing them.

At least it's nice outside.

I wonder why this keeps happening. I thought I would've figured out the answer by now.

I would've loved to be in the situation at other times, I wouldn't trade it, I just wish I had my previous perspective to look at this.

Just a strange melancholy that robs me of emotion. I'm a formerly thirsty person drowning now.

It would be nice to enjoy each single thing by itself, but of course life doesn't work that way.

Lara.

I wish she, no I wish I was in a better position to enjoy her company. I would've been estactic to have met her and gotten to know her under any other circumstances. I'm manifesting my neediness in hemoragging time. All will happen in good time of course, but she'll probably break my heart later down the line, leave me lonely.]


Once we grow up, we have to come to terms with what our parents have made us into and decide if we want to continue to be that thing or make different decisions.

We are the products of our parents' decisions but we can choose if we want to continue to be so.

### 04-28-2020  
I had dream of her, this is probably the first instance, but it's weird since I haven't dreamt much about anything recently, maybe I just don't remember them as well. Even BGS doesn't show up very often.

I'd push something too far and earned her ire, perhaps something to do with tutoring, I don't remember enough to pinpoint exactly why, but the consequence was that she wouldn't talk to me afterwards. The dream ran through four scenarios where she was in the vincinty but wouldn't make contact with me. Quite sad. I was devastated.

Woke up a bit muddled trying to reconciled reality with my dream and once I did, I was quite peeved at the emotional trauma my own brain conjured to put me through.

I hope this isn't foreshadowing anything.

I remember the frustrating thing talking to Isabel was that she would stonewall me every now and then, I couldn't figure her out and it bugged me to no end. I thought the best of her till the very end, and she turned out to be less than what I had imagined her to be, there wasn't much to learn and wonder if that's why she was so dodgey.

It's kind of weird being oddly confident that won't be that type of breakdown in communication with Siren.


### From Semester II's blue book

"Beauty is the promise of happiness." -Standal

It evaporated in the summer sun, and I was left grasping at nothing again. And if I was only seeing in black and white before, I was amazed by the vivid colors. If only it had lasted, or if I had died then, because I have to live knowing what it was like now.

-Break-

Diana Murell, and I wonder if I will ever find peace, because no matter where I go, it seems I go alone.

In Baytown, and every other place I had been, I was never really part of the place, only a passerby, perpetually, even when I stay for almost a decade. (It's like I'm always meant for someplace else.)

I started thinking that I'd always be there, I'd never stayed in a place for so long. I had gotten use to the quaintness of it, the routine, the predictability, a tiny slice of the world that was inconsequential, actions swallowed by its borders.

Kevin and I were always lone wolves, working on our own, finding the cardboard people there inefficient, dull, and boring. We could never get close, us too disdainful of them and them too perplexed by us.

We lived in the same place, but somehow we must've percieved it all differently, I don't know what I saw that they didn't.

When I got into Harvard, that really signaled the end of it. The end of pretending I could be anything like them. Those classrooms, we all started in the same place, had the same instruction, but how did I end up so far away then?

By then, at that point I belonged somewhere else, maybe a better place, but still somewhere else, when I stand here.

I've moved around pretty often, moreso in my first decade of life than these recent years. There was always a petulant whine to stay.

No matter where I go, my wool stays black.


I imagine most of my human experience is universal, and at that point I may not understand why there might be something wholly different about my human experience that prevents me from completely honestly interact with people, though I can get close enough.

Forgetting about the whole thing seems to be a good release from the leash. But as my memory of her fades, so does my indulgences in human shortcomings, in myself and others.

It's manifested in my barbed remarks and flashes of rage happening more frequentl. I have less patience and feel less volatile, but more cruel.



### Harvard Quiddtich

I first saw them at Visitas, I thought they were a bunch of nerds but they were having the most fun. I figured they were one of the very niche clubs that were most frivolous among the rest of them at the Redcliffe Quadrangle.
