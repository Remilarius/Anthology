<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<p>I think I got over it suprisingly quickly, being rejected, it didn&rsquo;t really hurt. I think I only realized the magnitude of which I could&rsquo;ve fucked up afterwards when I couln&rsquo;t debrief myself and nobody else could satisfactorily either.</p>
<h3 id="to-do-list">To Do List</h3>
<ol>
<li>Her birthday is June 9th</li>
<li>Give her red beans at some point</li>
</ol>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t tell if what do to myself sometimes is out of a sense of duty or just to cause myself suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating to have the foresight to be able to see exactly what problems will arise and being unable to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Fighting myself is hard.</p>
<h3 id="protocols">Protocols</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Contain the negativity and make sure she&rsquo;s not exposed to too much of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overstep and don&rsquo;t be protective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let her know how deep you&rsquo;re under</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be needy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a way to distract yourself if you&rsquo;re spiraling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patch up the soft spots and weak points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure she finds another friend/replacement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s not as confident as one would think, careful of that</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Deadline June 21th, 2021</p>
<p>I either need to get over it in the next month or so that I can interact normally or I need to tell her and be prepared to lose her.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother Saba about Siren</li>
<li>Tell Stephon the codename was apt and yell at him for not preventing this mess</li>
<li>Make sure they prevent the whole shipwreck phase</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="may-23-2021">May 23, 2021</h3>
<p>Harvard tryhards are a bunch of bottoms.</p>
<p>She needs to know I&rsquo;m not sticking around because I like her as more than her friend and I need to know she&rsquo;s not just coming to me because she doesn&rsquo;t have anyone else and is captive.</p>
<h3 id="may-22-2021">May 22, 2021</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how much she would&rsquo;ve been missed until after I tried debriefing myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the passing thought that I just wanted her as a friend but she wouldn&rsquo;t stay unless she had more and I agreed to keep her around at any cost, and that&rsquo;s now the only way I can make sure the people I care about stay.</p>
<h3 id="may-18-2021">May 18, 2021</h3>
<p>She called eariler this time. Probably anticipated the dinner time deadline.</p>
<p>I realized after that she reminds of me back in high school, wondering if my emotional range was confined to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play this game if I have to.</p>
<h3 id="may-17-2021">May 17, 2021</h3>
<p>She was taking 6 classes?? How did she still have time?</p>
<h3 id="may-16-2021">May 16, 2021</h3>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m going through withdrawal. This is a problem. I need to figure out a way to interact with her without losing my mind.</p>
<p>Most of these problems are self inflicted. I need to reduce thinking hours and let everything fall in perspective.</p>
<p>If only I could stop thinking.</p>
<h3 id="may-09-2021">May 09, 2021</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not certain.</p>
<p>She keeps peeling away my layers with ease.</p>
<p>When Dean Derzon and Shahara ask about these things, I dodge and I weave and I tell jokes to deflect, and they&rsquo;ve accused me of just as much, but they still couldn&rsquo;t pin me down even if they wanted too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the rules are arbitrary, I&rsquo;d rather be the arbiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the consequences, but we still have to yeild to reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent.&rdquo; -Alexander Hamilton</p>
<p>Condition 1: It’s determined that I have no chance, which in that case, she will either never know or it’ll be revealed to her in good time if we’re still on good terms.<br>
Condition 2: Recklessness (probably egged on by Stephon) + reasonable chance of things working out in my favor.<br>
Condition 3: My motives and decisions have been significantly compromised and she needs to know.<br>
Condition 4: It’s gone on for too long and she should know.<br>
Condition 5: We could be functionally dating and I’m a coward, in that case, the letter will be handed to her or I will tell her.</p>
<h3 id="something-i-mustve-written-late-semester">Something I must&rsquo;ve written late semester</h3>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t gotten better.</p>
<p>Your presence saturates my days. I&rsquo;m carried through my days in the stream of time, not thinking too much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s proper yet, if I don&rsquo;t want to repeat my mistakes, I should probably figure that out.</p>
<p>I remember being fairly needy texting wise near the end of my relationship with Yaretzi, which was an odd developement on my end, seeing as I could never reply to people on time.</p>
