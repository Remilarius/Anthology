      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always walking one step away from ruination.
I believe in power through competence.
From 11-16 years old, I had to make conscious deliberate decisions to change, looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s kinda crazy because people can&amp;rsquo;t usually just change one day on a whim, because of inertia or other reasons. I&amp;quot;ve really only settled here as a person in the last few years.
I like video games/media where you learn terrible truths.</description>

      <description>I. Life’s an open ended question, so what’s your answer? It’s not a good one but it’s the one I have for now
II. All those without a sun march in the dark. We don’t get a sun to see by, wandering in the dark until we figure it out.
III. Ying and Yang
IV. Vase
V. Puzzle
VI. Porcupine “Because it was my only defense against the cruelty in the this world, and while it protects me from the worst of it, it also prevents anyone from getting to close to me, lest they get hurt.</description>

      <description>And I wonder if I keep trying to find solace in another person to stop myself from chasing what I cannot obtain.
I am only good when I am in the grips of my rage.
Excerpts from Era Siren  [I need to stop thinking. People just need someone to care about them sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s just hard to let them in. It&amp;rsquo;s weird that you can understand what my friends can&amp;rsquo;t sometimes.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t feel anything, I can&amp;rsquo;t be happy, can&amp;rsquo;t be mad These days I just can&amp;rsquo;t stay awake I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I still wanna live My friends think I might have depression, Well if this is depression, I&amp;rsquo;ve had it for too long It goes away every once in a while and I think I&amp;rsquo;m safe but it always comes back
I guess I&amp;rsquo;m selfish, I won&amp;rsquo;t go to therapy I&amp;rsquo;ll take it out on the people around me</description>

      <description>Yeah, maybe I have a death wish It&amp;rsquo;s at the top of my bucket list
I can&amp;rsquo;t regulate my own emotions and I&amp;rsquo;m selfish, I won&amp;rsquo;t go to a therapist I&amp;rsquo;m afraid they won&amp;rsquo;t understand but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m special, it&amp;rsquo;s just the shit I&amp;rsquo;ve been through.
It’s just that the path I lead leaves me with just apathy And it makes me just a little bit
Numb,
You can hurt me all you want, I can&amp;rsquo;t feel the pain.</description>
