                                    <p>I&rsquo;m always walking one step away from ruination.</p>
<p>I believe in power through competence.</p>
<p>From 11-16 years old, I had to make conscious deliberate decisions to change, looking back, it&rsquo;s kinda crazy because people can&rsquo;t usually just change one day on a whim, because of inertia or other reasons. I&quot;ve really only settled here as a person in the last few years.</p>
<p>I like video games/media where you learn terrible truths.<br>

* Nier Automata<br>
* Fullmetal Alchemist<br>
* Fate Zero</p>
<p>My mum&rsquo;s threat to kick me out has been a long standing one. It&rsquo;s worn off by now, but it used to be very effective. I had no recourse but to accept the conditions she set. Now that I&rsquo;m older and more capable, that threat seems more like and invitation to escape instead.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;d rather freeze than wear that jacket.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been saying that&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll die at 29, hopefully having completed the problems I set out to solve. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m really joking, but it&rsquo;s alarming if I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine what lies beyond that year,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anything for me after that. I don&rsquo;t derive any pleasure from life it seems like, maybe that&rsquo;s why I want to be done and over with quickly.</p>
<p>What was the point?</p>
<h3 id="from-the-worst-co-worker">From the Worst Co-Worker</h3>
<p>It was easy when I didn&rsquo;t feel the same way, because I knew at some point they&rsquo;d be hurt but it wouldn&rsquo;t be me, I&rsquo;d feel sorry for them at some point, but that&rsquo;d be all.</p>

Oxygen’s low, lungs are starting to burn</p>

There’s nowhere to hide</p>
<p>I’m glad I was happy, even only for awhile
I should&rsquo;ve known it wouldn&rsquo;t last, it was only a trial</p>

<p>  [I need to stop thinking. People just need someone to care about them sometimes. It&rsquo;s just hard to let them in. It&rsquo;s weird that you can understand what my friends can&rsquo;t sometimes. You haven&rsquo;t personally experienced some of it, but you still are quite understanding.<br>
  You&rsquo;re not perturbed or shocked by some of what I&rsquo;ve told you. It&rsquo;s nice not to be treated like I&rsquo;m broken or inhuman.]</p>
<p>  [Chronologically, there might be an issue if I keep this to myself for too long. There&rsquo;s something to be said about pining heroically, but I&rsquo;m worried about my fondness clouding my motives and decisions regarding her.<br>
 I met her mid-October, and sporadically met for physics tutoring. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it then,]</p>
<p>[My mind is a mess. I can&rsquo;t keep anything straight, I keep thinking about everything I have to do instead of doing them.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s nice outside.</p>
<p>I wonder why this keeps happening. I thought I would&rsquo;ve figured out the answer by now.</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve loved to be in the situation at other times, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it, I just wish I had my previous perspective to look at this.</p>
<p>Just a strange melancholy that robs me of emotion. I&rsquo;m a formerly thirsty person drowning now.</p>
<p>It would be nice to enjoy each single thing by itself, but of course life doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p>I wish she, no I wish I was in a better position to enjoy her company. I would&rsquo;ve been estactic to have met her and gotten to know her under any other circumstances. I&rsquo;m manifesting my neediness in hemoragging time. All will happen in good time of course, but she&rsquo;ll probably break my heart later down the line, leave me lonely.]</p>
<p>Once we grow up, we have to come to terms with what our parents have made us into and decide if we want to continue to be that thing or make different decisions.</p>
<p>We are the products of our parents' decisions but we can choose if we want to continue to be so.</p>
<h3 id="04-28-2020">04-28-2020</h3>
<p>I had dream of her, this is probably the first instance, but it&rsquo;s weird since I haven&rsquo;t dreamt much about anything recently, maybe I just don&rsquo;t remember them as well. Even BGS doesn&rsquo;t show up very often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d push something too far and earned her ire, perhaps something to do with tutoring, I don&rsquo;t remember enough to pinpoint exactly why, but the consequence was that she wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me afterwards. The dream ran through four scenarios where she was in the vincinty but wouldn&rsquo;t make contact with me. Quite sad. I was devastated.</p>
<p>Woke up a bit muddled trying to reconciled reality with my dream and once I did, I was quite peeved at the emotional trauma my own brain conjured to put me through.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t foreshadowing anything.</p>
<p>I remember the frustrating thing talking to Isabel was that she would stonewall me every now and then, I couldn&rsquo;t figure her out and it bugged me to no end. I thought the best of her till the very end, and she turned out to be less than what I had imagined her to be, there wasn&rsquo;t much to learn and wonder if that&rsquo;s why she was so dodgey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird being oddly confident that won&rsquo;t be that type of breakdown in communication with Siren.</p>
<h3 id="from-semester-iis-blue-book">From Semester II&rsquo;s blue book</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty is the promise of happiness.&rdquo; -Standal</p>
<p>It evaporated in the summer sun, and I was left grasping at nothing again. And if I was only seeing in black and white before, I was amazed by the vivid colors. If only it had lasted, or if I had died then, because I have to live knowing what it was like now.</p>
<p>-Break-</p>
<p>Diana Murell, and I wonder if I will ever find peace, because no matter where I go, it seems I go alone.</p>
<p>In Baytown, and every other place I had been, I was never really part of the place, only a passerby, perpetually, even when I stay for almost a decade. (It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m always meant for someplace else.)</p>
<p>I started thinking that I&rsquo;d always be there, I&rsquo;d never stayed in a place for so long. I had gotten use to the quaintness of it, the routine, the predictability, a tiny slice of the world that was inconsequential, actions swallowed by its borders.</p>
<p>Kevin and I were always lone wolves, working on our own, finding the cardboard people there inefficient, dull, and boring. We could never get close, us too disdainful of them and them too perplexed by us.</p>
<p>We lived in the same place, but somehow we must&rsquo;ve percieved it all differently, I don&rsquo;t know what I saw that they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When I got into Harvard, that really signaled the end of it. The end of pretending I could be anything like them. Those classrooms, we all started in the same place, had the same instruction, but how did I end up so far away then?</p>
<p>By then, at that point I belonged somewhere else, maybe a better place, but still somewhere else, when I stand here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved around pretty often, moreso in my first decade of life than these recent years. There was always a petulant whine to stay.</p>
<p>No matter where I go, my wool stays black.</p>
<p>I imagine most of my human experience is universal, and at that point I may not understand why there might be something wholly different about my human experience that prevents me from completely honestly interact with people, though I can get close enough.</p>
<p>Forgetting about the whole thing seems to be a good release from the leash. But as my memory of her fades, so does my indulgences in human shortcomings, in myself and others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s manifested in my barbed remarks and flashes of rage happening more frequentl. I have less patience and feel less volatile, but more cruel.</p>

<p>I first saw them at Visitas, I thought they were a bunch of nerds but they were having the most fun. I figured they were one of the very niche clubs that were most frivolous among the rest of them at the Redcliffe Quadrangle.</p>
<p>rules are to prevent people from doing bad things</p>

                                    <p>I can&rsquo;t feel anything, I can&rsquo;t be happy, can&rsquo;t be mad
These days I just can&rsquo;t stay awake
I don&rsquo;t know if I still wanna live
My friends think I might have depression,
Well if this is depression, I&rsquo;ve had it for too long
It goes away every once in a while
and I think I&rsquo;m safe
but it always comes back</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m selfish, I won&rsquo;t go to therapy
I&rsquo;ll take it out on the people around me</p>
<p>The only way I know if I want to live is trying to die
and even then I can&rsquo;t seem to that</p>
<p>As the water closes over me,
It&rsquo;s calm for once
Is this the only way to know</p>
<p>Maybe I need other people to know what I am,
If they tell me, maybe I could do it</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you give up then?
Your actions and your words (don&rsquo;t make sense) are contradictory
You don&rsquo;t have it in you, do you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your place,
Go home
I don&rsquo;t belong, but can&rsquo;t I stay
No, it&rsquo;s not your place
Where is my place?
It&rsquo;s a grave, it&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll end up anyways
why don&rsquo;t you get there faster
None of it matters, why do you still try?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it matter.</p>
<p>You keep saying you want to off yourself,
so why don&rsquo;t you?
You say that you want to die, don&rsquo;t want to try,
so why don&rsquo;t you?
You&rsquo;ve already been written off a long time ago,
why do you still struggle?
If you&rsquo;re still waiting for an answer to your questions,
they&rsquo;re not coming,
it&rsquo;s not how the world works.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I cared enough to be hurt</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s only one way to find out. I would imagine before my lungs start to hurt, there&rsquo;ll be peace and the quiet that I&rsquo;ve been seeking.</p>
<p>I wake up when the sun does. In these early mornings, I&rsquo;m left alone. I can&rsquo;t tell if I want company or not.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m sitting on that bridge.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;m facing the same problem I was two years, I should be able to weather this better. I think I will.</p>
<p>I just need to do something else.</p>
<p>The person that comes out of this will be better, but I wonder what the cost will be. I&rsquo;ve always been faced with the decision of quitting or not, and I&rsquo;ve always chosen not to, despite the temptation.</p>
<p>I feel fragmented.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Saba&rsquo;s wrong about much, and I don&rsquo;t trust my own judgment right now.</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;m stubborn at times, I don&rsquo;t think I can change that</p>
<p>I wonder how much of my past I&rsquo;m still holding on to. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t matter anymore, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just very tired of being where I don&rsquo;t belong,</p>
<p>You can feel that person pulling away, just a little bit, and you realize it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they leave for certain. You can only prepare yourself and hope it only hurts so much.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an emotional blindspot. I dunno why considering that she&rsquo;s not as close as other people</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the amount of damage we could inflict on each other.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s flighty.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m alone, I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve think I&rsquo;ve told her once before that the worst thing someone could do to me was</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m powerless</p>
<p>I am a magnificent bastard, and I won&rsquo;t emotions of all things bring me down.</p>

                                    <p>Yeah, maybe I have a death wish
It&rsquo;s at the top of my bucket list</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t regulate my own emotions
and I&rsquo;m selfish, I won&rsquo;t go to a therapist
I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t understand but
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m special, it&rsquo;s just the shit I&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>It’s just that the path I lead leaves me with just apathy
And it makes me just a little bit</p>
<p>Numb,</p>
<p>You can hurt me all you want, I can&rsquo;t feel the pain.
There&rsquo;s something wrong with my brain, but I can&rsquo;t complain.</p>
<p>Life can’t get any tougher, I was meant to suffer.
But what does it all mean? I wonder.</p>
<p>You want me to give up that life,
But don&rsquo;t you see that&rsquo;s all I know?</p>
<p>Well to hell I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>You said I was your one and only,
but you said that just to own me
said that to try to control me</p>
<p>What if I can&rsquo;t get back up?
What if I want to die
Won&rsquo;t you let me?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you come find me?<br>
I&rsquo;m just a little bit lost in time<br>
There&rsquo;s nothing I can call mine</p>
<p>Children pay for the sins of their parents<br>
The toll from all these problems that we inherit<br>
Couldn&rsquo;t be made more apparent<br>
when our dreamscapes are so barren</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not where I&rsquo;m suppose to be<br>
Suppose to live out my life in obscurity<br>
Surprised they&rsquo;re not calling security</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just harmonic motion<br>
Who gave you the right to come into my heart and cause a commotion</p>
<p>I got the fight beat into me<br>
That&rsquo;s all I know how to do<br>
Best take me for a fool</p>
